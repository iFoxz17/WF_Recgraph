                  of short reads data at decreasing cost. De novo sequence
                  assembly is the problem of combining these reads back to the
                  original genome sequence, without relying on a reference
                  genome. This presents algorithmic and computational
                  challenges, especially for long and repetitive genome
                  sequences. Most existing approaches to the assembly problem
                  operate in the framework of de Bruijn graphs. Yet, a number of
                  recent works use the paradigm of string graph, using a variety
                  of methods for storing and processing suffixes and prefixes,
                  like suffix arrays, the Burrows–Wheeler transform or the FM
                  index. Our work is motivated by a search for new approaches to
                  constructing the string graph, using alternative yet simple
                  data structures and algorithmic concepts.Results: We introduce
                  a novel hash-based method for constructing the string graph.
                  We use incremental hashing, and specifically a modification of
                  the Karp–Rabin fingerprint, and Bloom filters. Using these
                  probabilistic methods might create false-positive and
                  false-negative edges during the algorithm’s execution, but
                  these are all detected and corrected. The advantages of the
                  proposed approach over existing methods are its simplicity and
                  the incorporation of established probabilistic techniques in
                  the context of de novo genome sequencing. Our preliminary
                  implementation is favorably comparable with the first string
                  graph construction of Simpson and Durbin (2010) (but not with
                  subsequent improvements). Further research and optimizations
                  will hopefully enable the algorithm to be incorporated, with
                  noticeable performance improvement, in state-of-the-art string
                  graph-based assemblers.Availability and implementation: A beta

abstract ={Summary: We present a new method to incrementally construct the FM-index for both short and long sequence reads, up to the size of a genome. It is the first algorithm that can build the index while implicitly sorting the sequences in the reverse (complement) lexicographical order without a separate sorting step. The implementation is among the fastest for indexing short reads and the only one that practically works for reads of averaged kilobases in length.Availability and implementation: https://github.com/lh3/ropebwt2Contact: hengli@broadinstitute.org},

	abstract = {Deep sequencing has enabled the investigation of a wide range of environmental microbial ecosystems, but the high memory requirements for {\textbackslash}em de novo assembly of short-read shotgun sequencing data from these complex populations are an increasingly large practical barrier. Here we introduce a memory-efficient graph representation with which we can analyze the k-mer connectivity of metagenomic samples. The graph representation is based on a probabilistic data structure, a Bloom filter, that allows us to efficiently store assembly graphs in as little as 4 bits per k-mer, albeit inexactly. We show that this data structure accurately represents DNA assembly graphs in low memory. We apply this data structure to the problem of partitioning assembly graphs into components as a prelude to assembly, and show that this reduces the overall memory requirements for {\textbackslash}em de novo assembly of metagenomes. On one soil metagenome assembly, this approach achieves a nearly 40-fold decrease in the maximum memory requirements for assembly. This probabilistic graph representation is a significant theoretical advance in storing assembly graphs and also yields immediate leverage on metagenomic assembly},

abstract ={GenBank® is a comprehensive database that contains publicly available nucleotide sequences for over 280 000 formally described species. These sequences are obtained primarily through submissions from individual laboratories and batch submissions from large-scale sequencing projects, including whole-genome shotgun and environmental sampling projects. Most submissions are made using the web-based BankIt or standalone Sequin programs, and GenBank staff assign accession numbers upon data receipt. Daily data exchange with the European Nucleotide Archive and the DNA Data Bank of Japan ensures worldwide coverage. GenBank is accessible through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez retrieval system, which integrates data from the major DNA and protein sequence databases along with taxonomy, genome, mapping, protein structure and domain information, and the biomedical journal literature via PubMed. BLAST provides sequence similarity searches of GenBank and other sequence databases. Complete bimonthly releases and daily updates of the GenBank database are available by FTP.

	abstract = {Motivation: The Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT) is the foundation of many algorithms for compression and indexing of text data, but the cost of computing the BWT of very large string collections has prevented these techniques from being widely applied to the large sets of sequences often encountered as the outcome of DNA sequencing experiments. In previous work, we presented a novel algorithm that allows the BWT of human genome scale data to be computed on very moderate hardware, thus enabling us to investigate the BWT as a tool for the compression of such datasets.
Results: We first used simulated reads to explore the relationship between the level of compression and the error rate, the length of the reads and the level of sampling of the underlying genome and compare choices of second-stage compression algorithm.
We demonstrate that compression may be greatly improved by a particular reordering of the sequences in the collection and give a novel ‘implicit sorting’ strategy that enables these benefits to be realized without the overhead of sorting the reads. With these techniques, a 45× coverage of real human genome sequence data compresses losslessly to under 0.5 bits per base, allowing the 135.3 Gb of sequence to fit into only 8.2 GB of space (trimming a small proportion of low-quality bases from the reads improves the compression still further).
This is {\textgreater}4 times smaller than the size achieved by a standard BWT-based compressor (bzip2) on the untrimmed reads, but an important further advantage of our approach is that it facilitates the building of compressed full text indexes such as the FM-index on large-scale DNA sequence collections.
Availability: Code to construct the BWT and SAP-array on large genomic datasets is part of the BEETL library, available as a github repository at https://github.com/BEETL/BEETL.

abstract = "The object of the shortest common superstring problem (SCS) is to find the shortest possible string that contains every string in a given set as substrings. As the problem is NP-complete, approximation algorithms are of interest. The value of an aproximate solution to \{SCS\} is normally taken to be its length, and we seek algorithms that make the length as small as possible. A different measure is given by the sum of the overlaps between consecutive strings in a candidate solution. When considering this measure, the object is to find solutions that make it as large as possible. These two measures offer different ways of viewing the problem. While the two viewpoints are equivalent with respect to optimal solutions, they differ with respect to approximate solutions. We describe several approximation algorithms that produce solutions that are always within a factor of two of optimum with respect to the overlap measure. We also describe an efficient implementation of one of these, using McCreight's compact suffix tree construction algorithm. The worstcase running time is O(m log n) for small alphabets, where m is the sum of the lengths of all the strings in the set and n is the number of strings. For large alphabets, the algorithm can be implemented in O(m log m) time by using Sleator and Tarjan's lexicographic splay tree data structure. "

Given a set R of strings, the algorithm constructs a common superstring for R in O(mn) steps where m is the number of strings in R and n is the total length of these strings. The performance of the algorithm is analysed in terms of the compression in the common superstrings constructed, that is, in terms of n−k where k is the length of the obtained superstring. We show that (n−k)⩾12(n−kmin) where kmin is the length of a shortest common superstring. Hence the compression achieved by the algorithm is at least half of the maximum compression. It also seems that the lengths always satisfy k⩽2·kmin but proving this remains open."

Logic, algorithms, applications, Springer, Berlin, pp 353--364, 2013) have introduced external-memory algorithms to compute self-indexes of a set of strings, mainly via computing the {B}urrows--Wheeler transform of the input strings. The motivations for those results stem from Bioinformatics, where a large number of short strings (called reads) are routinely produced and analyzed. In that field, a fundamental problem is to assemble a genome from a large set of much shorter samples extracted from the unknown genome. The approaches that are currently used to tackle this problem are memory-intensive. This fact does not bode well with the ongoing increase in the availability of genomic data. A data structure that is used in genome assembly is the string graph, where vertices correspond to samples and arcs represent two overlapping samples. In this paper we address an open problem of Simpson and Durbin (Bioinformatics 26(12):i367--i373, 2010): to design an external-memory algorithm to compute the string graph.",
